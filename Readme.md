### Simple experimental proxy server designed specifically for the rpi 3 w/2GB of RAM running almost any flavor or linux.

Some notes:
- This is nowhere near complete. Currently only working with HTTP (not HTTPS) get requests.
- Compile with "make proxy-server" and run with "./proxy-server [SERVER PORT NUMBER]"
